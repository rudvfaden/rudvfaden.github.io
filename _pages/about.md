My name is Rud. I currently work at Jyske Bank in Denmark. The third-largest Danish bank.
I work as a data engineer. That means that I design and maintain our company's data warehouse. I focus on designing functional, consistent, and easily maintainable data solutions.

I am educated as an economist at the University of Copenhagen. But I have worked primarily as a data engineer for the last ten years. First at the Capital Region in Copenhagen and from Aug. 2021 in Jyske Bank.
