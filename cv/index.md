I live and breathe economics and Internet. Main main area of research is dynamic aspects of health economics, which is a lot more fun than it sounds. I am motivated by a natural interest in how people make choices in health care. In my spare time i love to fiddle with high tech gadgets and fun geeky software. I also like to program, which is why i made this home page. When i am not caught up in a fun algorithm or an interesting work problem, i like to spend time with my family and friends.
